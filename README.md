This unit will allow the slowing and by manual step pulses to a microprocessor clock for debugging and display purposes. Choices for the automatic clock are a 20uS pulse for every 1, 1.5, 2 and 2.5 seconds duration period (red led will flash when generated). Selections for this are available by pressing the green button to scroll through the options The manual step is available to generate a single 20uS pulse for every press of the yellow button. The red button starts and stops the automatic clock.

ATMEGA328P microcontroller with a Logiswitch ls-118 hardware debouncing chip. Programmed in Atmel Studio 7, simulation testing in Proteus 8 VSIM and schematic and board designs done in Easy-eda software.

This with some 7-Segment hex 8 bit decoder boards will make a way to step through a program on a microprocessor.
